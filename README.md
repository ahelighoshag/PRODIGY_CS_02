# PRODIGY_CS_02

📁 PRODIGY_CS_02 – Image Encryption Tool
📌 Project Title

Image Encryption and Decryption Using Pixel Manipulation

📝 Description

This project demonstrates a simple image encryption and decryption technique by manipulating pixel values.
The encrypted image appears visually distorted, and the original image can be fully recovered using the corresponding decryption script.

⚙️ Features

Encrypts image files using pixel value transformation

Decrypts encrypted images back to their original form

Uses the same logic/key for both encryption and decryption

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

Pillow (PIL) library

📂 Files Included

encrypt.py – Script to encrypt the image

decrypt.py – Script to decrypt the encrypted image

image.jpg – Original image

encrypted.png – Encrypted image output

decrypted.png – Decrypted image output

▶️ How to Run
Install the required library
pip install pillow

Run the encryption script
python encrypt.py

Run the decryption script
python decrypt.py

🎯 Learning Outcome

Understanding image-based encryption techniques

Working with image pixels using Python

Learning the basics of data confidentiality in multimedia files

✅ Notes

Ensure the input image is present in the project directory

Encryption and decryption must use the same transformation logic
Encryption and decryption must use the same transformation logic
